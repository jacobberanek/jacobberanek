- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob Beranek

Im currently a sophomore at Auburn University studying Software Engineering

I am interested in software development, not sure what concentration yet, but some sort of app development and/or website development most likely, I have also been looking into AI recently as it also seems interesting.
I am planning on teaching myself javascript as well as get familiarized with libraries such as React, aswell as get familiar with basic API's.

Language Experiences:
- Java
- C++
- Python
