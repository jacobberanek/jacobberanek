- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob Beranek

Im currently a sophomore at Auburn University studying Software Engineering

I am interested in software development, and have been looking into AI recently as it also seems interesting.
I am planning on teaching myself javascript at some point and as well as get familiarized with libraries such as React, aswell as get familiar with basic API's.

Language Experiences:
- Java
- C++
- Python
